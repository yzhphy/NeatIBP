In SyzygyRed.wl

I have changed "!=" somewhere to "=!="  (zihao 2022.04 .06)
I have changed the name of variable "FF" to "FF1" in function \
SingularIdeal, to avoid possible contradiction with FiniteFlow. \
(zihao 2022.04 .08)
I have added some timing reports in the codes. 
  For this, a new variable is declared named TimingReportOfRowReduce. \
(zihao 2022.04 .08)
I have added many time reports (zihao someday)
I have added "exit;" in SingularIntersectionText and SingularSyzText \
in order to use them in command line (zihao 2022.04 .25)
I added PrintAndLog function. I replaced all Print[ 
  to PrintAndLog[ (zihao 2022.04 .29)
       I added an option to probe (zihao 2022.05 .03)
       
       zihao 2022.05 .06 :
      Function pivots[matrix] is defined twice. 
        I removed the first one. 
        I have make the RowReduceFunction optional. 
        By default using Hefeng`s SRSparseRowReduce.
        I have changed the default prime modulus from 32452843 to 42013
       I have modified \
"Mext=Join[Transpose[M],IdentityMatrix[M//Length]]//Transpose" to \
"Mext=Join[Transpose[M],SparseIdentityMatrix[M//Length]]//Transpose" 
       	in function UsedRelations. Where SparseIdentityMatrix[n_] := 
     SparseArray[Table[{k, k} -> 1, {k, n}]]
      	
      zihao 2022.05 .07
      I have deleted the step "CollectG" in function SectorAnalyze
      
      zihao 2022.05 .09
      In function SectorAnalyze, 
    		IBPISPdegrees = 
     IBPISPSectorDegree[#, sector] & /@ (CornerIBP /. GenericD // 
          Expand)
       has been modified to 
       		IBPISPdegrees = IBPISPSectorDegree[
         			Collect[
          				# /. GenericD /. GenericPoint,
          				Cases[Variables[#], _G]
          			]
         			, sector
         		] & /@ (CornerIBP);
    		
    zihao 2022.05 .12  
     when cauculating sector #938 of the triplebox example, 
    the SingularIntersection returned a VectorList, 
    such that VectorList[[212]] = 0, 
    but it is supposed to be a vector, not 0.
     The phenomenon comes from the Singular running step, 
    after simplify (m12, 12) command, 
    the 212 th element of the result matrix is 0, 
    but it is supposed to be linear combinations of gen ( ...)
     The Singular website is failed, 
    so I cannot study why this is happening (maybe because the \
simplification mode 12)
     The problem singular script is in  /home/zihao/projects/
         SyzygyRed/Parallelization/test_triplebox/
      intersection_test _bug _ 938. sing, 
    we should study what maybe wrong as soon as the Singular website \
recovered.
      Now, we have no choice but to add a command 
     If[Count[vectors, 0] > 0, 
      PrinAndLog["#", secNum, 
       "  ZEROs in VectorList Encountored!!They are deleted."]; 
      vectors = DeleteCases[vectors, 0]]; 
    in function IntersectionRead.
       BUT REMEMBER!! This is a YAN - ER - DAO - LING behaviour, 
    because it is possible that there DO EXIST some BUGs in the \
Singular step, 
    and we just temply turn off the warning ... so ... The result may \
be WRONG!
     MAKE SURE you fix the possible bug once Singular website \
recover!/home/zihao/projects/SyzygyRed/Parallelization/
      test_double _pentagon/Analyze_Sector.wl
     
     zihao  2022.05 .13
     Singular web site has recovered.
      After looking it up, we can delete the command 
     If[Count[vectors, 0] > 0, 
      PrinAndLog["#", secNum, 
       "  ZEROs in VectorList Encountored!!They are deleted."]; 
      vectors = DeleteCases[vectors, 0]]; 
    in function IntersectionRead. 
      There seems to be no error. 
      What we only need to do is just modify the OptionSimplification \
from 12 to 14.
     
     zihao 2022.05 .16
     I added option in SectorAnalyze to choose module intersection \
method, Linear or Singular
      
      zihao 2022.05 .18
      required the program to report ByteCount of VectorList
      
      zihao 2022.05 .24
      Added an option to shorten the module M1 and M2
      
      In function SingularIntersectionMaker 
      varpara = Variables[Join[M1, M2]];
    is modified to 
      varpara = Variables[Join[M1ext, M2]];
    
    in string SingularIntersectionText
      module m = m1 + m2; is modified to module m = m1, m2;
    
    zihao 2022.09 .09
     added functions :
      FIBPSectorISPDegree
       FIntegralSectorISPDegree
       In function SectorAnalyze, 
    	IBPISPdegrees = IBPISPSectorDegree[
        			Collect[
         				# /. GenericD /. GenericPoint,
         				Cases[Variables[#], _G]
         			]
        			, sector
        		] & /@ (CornerIBP);
    has been modified to 
      IBPISPdegrees = FIBPSectorISPDegree[#, sector] & /@ FIBPs;
    Before the modification, 
    Zurich seeding gives more MIs than expected.

=======================
ver 2
=======================


-----------------------------
2022.09.13
support calculation in one folder


-----------------------------
2022.09.20
made a backup


-----------------------------
2022.09.22
[I]
put codes in Symmetry.wl into SyzygyRed.wl , but it still needs to include Pak.wl\

In SyzygyRed.wl added a step, sector mapping, before removing zero sector integrals (nearly at the botom of main function). Consequently, there will be no new target integrals in mapped sectors while complying AnalyzeSector.wl. 

[II]
Changed "Initialization.wl" so that:

A.set a framewor to deal with mapped integral targets.
The framework is set as:
1. The only mapped targets will occur as an input. If NeedSymmetry Option is turned on, we map these targets at initilalization, export the symmetry relations as IBPs, and export {} as MI.
2. Export the mission status of mapped sectors to be "ComputationFinished"

B.Moreover, at initialization, we additionally export zero integrals as zero.

[III]
created summary.wl
----------------------------------
2022.09.23

[I]
In SyzygyRed.wl
For[i=1,i<=Length[Global`NonZeroSectors],i++,
			subsector=Global`NonZeroSectors[[i]];
			Global`ReductionTasks[subsector]=Union[Global`ReductionTasks[subsector],Select[SubsectorInts,Sector[#]==subsector&]];
		];

changed Global`NonZeroSectors to tailSectors(=DeleteDuplicates[Sector/@SubsectorInts])

[II]
Added function MappedAndSubSectorsAllFinder in SyzygyRed.wl
Modified AnalyzeSector.wl to use MappedAndSubSectorsAllFinder rather than SubsectorAllFinder to find RelavantSectors if NeedSymmetry is on. However, Initialization.wl temply remain the same, this may cause trouble when input targets are not in top sector but in separate subsectors. NEED TO BE IMPROVED!!!

[III]
Cancelled function SuperSectors[] in all .wl files but MissionStatusChecke.wl, because it is not used theres.

Modified function SuperSectors[] in MissionStatusChecke.wl (backuped old version using (**)). Originally, master missions were calculated real-timely. In new version, this tree structure is calculated at initialization and saved on the disk. The new function only read it and use.

[IV]
made a backup 


-----------------------
2022.09.26
[I]
In function SyzygyRed.wl, the step "sorting nFIPBs" is too slow, sometimes taking 50% the time cost.
I added some timeing reports in this step. 
As observed, the bottle neck link is IBPSubSectorDegree <- IntegralList <- SortBy
The IntegralList command automatically sort the integrals, but in this step we do not need.
So, I added an option to function IntegralList, to determine weather we sort the integrals. Default is yes.
Then ,I added option value SortTheIntegrals->False to function IntegralList where it was called by: 
IBPWeight
IBPSubSectorDegree
IBPISPSectorDegree
Length

[II]
added a criterion of step "sort nFIBPs": ByteCount

[III]
added function SectorSelfSymmetryIBPs

[IV]
made a backup. We will keep on adding symmetry inside sectors




----------------------
2022.09.27

[I]
Add sector self symmetry related codes in SyzygyRed.wl

modified codes from 

	nIBPs=rawIBPs/.FI[i_]:>nFIBPs[[i]]/.IntegralR->IntegralRealization;

		newNIBPs=newNIBPs/.Cut;
		nIBPs=Join[nIBPs,newNIBPs]
	];
Added codes afer Zurich seedings:
If[Not[NeedSymmetry===False],
	timer2=AbsoluteTime[];
	If[OptionValue[Verbosity]==1,PrintAndLog["#",secNo,"  \t","Appending self-symmetries at current step..."];];

	seeds=Flatten[SeedMerge[NumeratorShifts[sector,#],DenominatorTypes]&/@Range[0,OptionValue[ZurichInitialSteps]],1];
	
	rawIBPs=Join[

		Table[SelfSymmetryR[ZM[i],seeds[[j]]],{i,1,Length[zMaps]},{j,1,Length[seeds]}]//Flatten
	];
	
	nIBPs=Join[
		nIBPs,
		Table[SelfSymmetryRealization[zMaps[[i]]/.GenericPoint,seeds[[j]]],{i,1,Length[zMaps]},{j,1,Length[seeds]}]//Flatten
	];
	If[OptionValue[Verbosity]==1,PrintAndLog["#",secNo,"  ","\t\tAppending self-symmetries finished. Time Used: ", Round[AbsoluteTime[]-timer2], " second(s)."]];
	
	];
or 

If[Not[NeedSymmetry===False],
		timer2=AbsoluteTime[];
		If[OptionValue[Verbosity]==1,PrintAndLog["#",secNo,"  \t","Appending self-symmetries at current step..."];];
		seeds=Flatten[SeedMerge[NumeratorShifts[sector,#],DenominatorTypes]&/@Range[0,OptionValue[ZurichInitialSteps]],1];
		NewrawIBPs=Join[

		If[OptionValue[Verbosity]==1,PrintAndLog["#",secNo,"  ","\t\tAppending self-symmetries finished. Time Used: ", Round[AbsoluteTime[]-timer2], " second(s)."]];
	];



At step obtaining the analytic IBPs, added codes:
(it seems nothing need to be added here --- 2022.10.13)
--------------
2022.09.28
[I]
made a backup

[II]
added SparseRREF package in the working folder. Modified <<SparseRREF` to Get[workingPath<>"SparseRREF/SparseRREF.m"]
After this , we expect that user no longer need to install SparseRREF manually when they get this program

--------------------
2022.10.13
[I]
renamed "Pak" to "Pak_Algorithm"
deleted functions not used in the package Pak_Algorithm.wl

[II]
fixed an error in Initialization.wl
modified 
mapIBPs=#-(#/.G[x__]:>GMapped[sectorMaps,{x}])&/@mappedTargets;
to
mapIBPs=#-(SymmetryMap[sectorMaps,#])&/@mappedTargets;

the former one is old wrong way of mapping

[III]
modified
SDim=Length[Flatten[MIs][[1]]/.G->List]
in Summary.wl to
SDim=Length[Cases[Variables[IBPs],_G][[1]]/.G->List]

================================
ver 3
================================
Statement:
Ver2 is up-to-date at 2022.10.13
In the new version I am going to refine the folder structure, which will be brand new. 
Also, the backup branch is pushed to github named 'branch20221013'. 
The Folder 'SyzygyRed_Parallel_v2' should be remained unchanged from now
--------------------------
2022.11.07
made a backup (codes only, no .git or more github related files) at 'github' folder

--------------------------
2022.11.14
[I]
seperated the workingPath and packagePath in all codes. 
removed the SyzygyRedPackagePath variable, it is useless.
moved settings
	SingularDirectory = "/usr/bin/Singular"
	IntegralOrder = "Global"
	OptionSimplification = 12;
into input files.
Added outputPath=Automatic. We need to test what if it is not Automatic (tested)

-------------------------------
2022.11.15
made some adjustments to tha shell scripts (and .wl files) to fit in the changes yesterday.

(**)ed codes
Print["If you see an error message saying cannot open LinearSyzForLinearModule_FF_v2.wl, you can ignore it for the current version:"]
Get["/home/zihao/projects/SyzygyRed/LinearSyz/LinearSyzForLinearModule_FF_v2.wl"]
in SyzygyRed.wl

renamed SingularDirectory to SingularApp to avoid confusion, in SyzygyRed.wl and config.txt

------------------------------
2022.11.16
made a backup (for new developments for Cuts)


some modifications in Initialization.wl, preparing for cuts

-------------------------------
2022.11.17
allowing cuts

modified Cuts in SectorAnalyze[] in SyzygyRed,wl to sectorCuts to avoid name contradiction

Continue:
Add Cut opetion in AnalyzeSector.wl

put some temp files into tmp folder (where they should be)

if outputPath dosenot end with "/", add a "/"

-------------------------------
2022.11.28

modified in SyzygyRed.wl: from 
Std[f_,ref_]:=Total[(G@@(ref-#[[1]]))*#[[2]]&/@CoefficientRules[f,var,DegreeReverseLexicographic]];
to 
Std[f_,ref_]:=Total[(G@@(ref-#[[1]]))*Factor[#[[2]]]&/@CoefficientRules[f,var,DegreeReverseLexicographic]];

modified in MappedIntegral[zMap_,indices_] in SyzygyRed.wl 
Gn=Total[(G@@(#[[1]]))*(#[[2]])&/@crn];
to
Gn=Total[(G@@(#[[1]]))*(Factor[#[[2]]])&/@crn];

-------------------------------
2022.11.29

In SyzygyRed.wl - SectorAnalyze
1.put after the position of "IntegralRealization"
originally it is between "independent IBP" and "used IBP"
now it is put after "used IBP"
this will save some time

2.Removed a line in oerlikon algorithm:
SectorIntegrals=IntegralList[nIBPs]
sincxe SectorIntegrals is never used in the rest part of the function

3. modified 
rawIBPs=CoefficientArrays[rawIBPs,integrals][[2]].integrals;
to
rawIBPs=Factor[CoefficientArrays[rawIBPs,integrals][[2]]].integrals;

4.recovered the 2 modifications yesterday. I do not think it is a good idea to factor with m[i]s 

--------------------
2022.11.30

1.refined PrintAndLog Function in SyzygyRed.wl and Analyze_Sector.wl

2.add an option KillCornerSubsecIBPs in SyzygyRed.wl, to turn off a step in it
	(* Remove IBPs for lower sectors *)
	(* But this will wrongly kill some IBPs that generates IBPs not for lower sectors at non-corner seed*)
	(* I (zihao) suggest we turn off this step, the subsec IBPs will be automatically removed in the next steps so it is not needed here to do so*)

--------------------
2022.12.1

1.add a step removing subsector IBPs before sorting nFIBPs

--------------------
2022.12.11

1.built a backup 

2.start to fix an important problem:

What if a Analyze_Sector (AS) worker failed?
Solution:
Plan A: detect process name. If no such process, send a warning.
Plan B: detect running time, if it is abnormally large, send a warning

I chose plan A

But we need to face with a problem: The process command name must be distinguished in case the user runs 2 NeatIBP at a time:
we need to modify the command line of AS, to put the outputPath as the third argument of the command.

we used outputPath to distinguish different NeatIBP missions, in usual this is ok, but assuming the user could make a mistake, I put in a relevant warning in Initialzation.wl while deleting outputPath dir.s

3.added reading default settings 


--------------------
2023.1.12
In SyzygyRed.wl, function SectorMaps:
modified 
undeterminedSectors=sectors
to 
undeterminedSectors=Reverse[sectors]
so that the symmetry mapping preference is consistent with sector ordering (before that, they are reversed to each other.)


-----------------------
2023.1.18
In SyzygyRed.wl, function GMap:
added an operation G->GZeroSectorCut (a newly defined function added today)
to get rid of zero integrals after GMap

-----------------------
2023.2.6
1. fixed a bug at continue.sh (originally summary step missed)
2. input back up files will be put in a single folder
3. added usage: check ibp
4. labeled version: 1.0.0.0
5. modified version label: 1.0.0.1

---------------------------------
2023.3.14

Concerning user report of errors, added :
debugModification20230314=True
and

This is a hourse-butt-effect bug.

[II]
In SyzygyRed.wl
Modified 
If[OptionValue[KillCornerSubsecFIBPs],
		If[OptionValue[Verbosity]==1,PrintAndLog["#",secNo,"  Removing IBPs for lower sectors..."]];
		FIBPs1={};
		CornerIBP={};
	
		For[i=1,i<=Length[FIBPs],i++,
			baseIBP=IntegralRealization[FIBPs[[i]],sector];
		
			If[(baseIBP/.sectorCut)===0&&(Union[VectorList[[i,propLocus]]/.BaikovCut]==={0}),
				Continue[];  (* This IBP corresponds to a lower sector *)

		If[OptionValue[Verbosity]==1,PrintAndLog["#",secNo,"\t  ",Length[FIBPs]," Formal IBPs are generated; ",Length[FIBPs1]," Formal IBPs are used. "(*,AbsoluteTime[]-timer*)];];
		FIBPs=FIBPs1;
		If[OptionValue[Verbosity]==1,PrintAndLog["#",secNo,"\t  IBPs for lower sectors removed. Time Used: ", Round[AbsoluteTime[]-timer], " second(s)."]];
	];
	
to

of course, modified default that KillCornerSubsecFIBPs->True

[II]
deleted the old logs in the source code in SyzygyRed.wl

[III]
some linguistic corrections, Comply->Perform

[IV]
Supporting seeding via FIBP Functions. This will make the seeding faster than seeding via replacement.
Detailed modifications:
1.added
If[seedingViaFIBPFunction,
	ClearAll[IntegralRealization];
	PrintAndLog["seedingViaFIBPFunction is on, redefining IntegralRealization."];
	IntegralRealization[FundamentalIBP_,degree_]:=FundamentalIBP@@degree;
]
under 
IntegralRealization[FundamentalIBP_,degree_]:=FundamentalIBP/.Dispatch[Table[m[i]->degree[[i]],{i,1,SDim}]];
2. modified
		Return[term1+term2];
to
If[seedingViaFIBPFunction,
		Return[Evaluate[term1+term2/.Table[m[i]->Slot[i],{i,1,SDim}]]&];
	,
		Return[term1+term2];
	]

in function
IBPGenerator and IBPCutGenerator

[V]
label to a new version: 1.0.0.2



--------------------------------
2023.4.10
[I]
recovered the modfification [IV] in 2023.4.7
but added a redefinition after each of the 2 functions

added a redefinition to Std[ 

[II]
 added 
If[sectorID=!=-1,
	LogFile=LogPath<>ToString[sectorID]<>".txt";
]
in the front of  Analyze_Sector.wl
and commented out this in the latter codes

[III]
modified 
FIntegralSectorISPDegree[fInt_,sector_]:=((fInt/.m[_]->0)/.G->List).(sector-1)
to
FIntegralSectorISPDegree[fInt_,sector_]:=(IntegralRealization[fInt,Table[0,SDim]]/.G->List).(sector-1)
in SyzygyRed.wl 
in order to meet the Functionalized seeding

commented out
IntegralReal[indices_]:=Dispatch[Table[m[i]->indices[[i]],{i,1,SDim}]];
in SyzygyRed.wl 
not used function.

[IV]
REIMPLEMENTING Functionalized seeding!:
commented out all redifinition of functions in SyzygyRed.wl when seedingViaFIBPFunction=True
Defined a new function ZurichSeedingVianFIBPFunctions to seed from nFIBPFunctions.
But we temply donot support seeding via functions in Direct seeding Mode, I have left a warning message in the codes. If user uses Direct Mode, they will see it

[V]
created a backup branch

[VI]
added memory report


[VII]
added 
If[sectorID=!=-1,
	LogFile=LogPath<>ToString[sectorID]<>".txt";
]
in Analyze_Sector.wl
right after Getting SyzygyRed.wl

-----------------------------
2023.4.11
[I]
added sow and reap in ZuirchSeeding functions

[II]
Added ParallelTable in SectorMaps function.


-----------------------------
2023.4.12
[I]
Plugin azuritino, many modifications

[II]
moved finding self-symmetries to the front of AnalyzeSector[...] in SyzygyRed.wl, and give it a If to turn it off if Symmetry is off

[III]
added self symmetry in Azuritino

[IV]
modified 
FIBPISPdegree=IBPISPSectorISPDegree[#,sector]&/@(FIBPs/.m[a_]->0);
to 
FIBPISPdegree=FIBPSectorISPDegree[#,sector]&/@(FIBPs);
in AzuritinoMIFind[...]
to fix a bug

and modified its default degBound->0

----------------------------------
2023.4.13
[I]
added version notice in the beginning

[II]
fixed an mistake code in zurich seeding for loop steps:
modified
Flatten[SeedMerge[NumeratorShifts[sector,#],DenominatorTypes]&/@Range[0,OptionValue[ZurichInitialSteps]],1]
to
seeds=Flatten[SeedMerge[NumeratorShifts[sector,#],DenominatorTypes]&/@{step},1]
this is an apparant mistake... though not causing severe errors, but it will make the IBP relations a little more (lacking some self symmetry relations in high degree, who should be there.)

[III]
let the user to input finite field modulus, AzuritinoIntersectionDegreeBound, and NeatIBPIntersectionDegreeBound

[IV]
commented out double defined or unneeded function in SyzygyRed.wl: 
IBPWeight
IntegralSectorOrder
BlockMatrix
SectorWeightMatrix

redefined:
IntegralWeight

[V]
some Global symbols in Critical point implementations, cc and w. modified them to local vars

[VI]
added codes in Initialization.wl:
If[FileExistsQ[#],Run["rm "<>#]]&[outputPath<>"tmp/"<>"initialized.txt"];
to fix: if a ini failed running with an existing outputPath, the program will summarize again... unconfortable.


[VII]
exchanged position of section Validating Inputs and section Setting outputPath in Initialization.wl

[VIII]
Allow user to determine whether singular temporary files should be deleted once they are used. Yes by default.

[IX]
Modified a sequential evaluation to parallelized in CheckIBP.wl.:Analyzing reduction results (step 2/3)

[X]
modified
SectorIntegrals=Select[IntegralList[nIBPs,SortTheIntegrals->False],Sector[#]==sector&];
to
SectorIntegrals=Select[IntegralList[nIBPs,SortTheIntegrals->False],Sector[#]==sector&];
SectorIntegrals=SortBy[SectorIntegrals,IntegralOrdering]//Reverse;
in SyzygyRed.wl (only in Zurich method, ommiting Direct)

-------------------------------------------
2023.4.14
[I]
Hefeng updated SparseRREF to allow SRFindPivots

[II]
deleted some unneeded codes in SyzygyRed.wl related to probeTheFunctions
commented out unused function IBPtest in SyzygyRed.wl

[III]
add an option to use SRFindPivots in IndepedentSet

[IV]
modified Sector[#]!=sector& to Sector[#]=!=sector& in function IBPSubSectorDegree in SyzygyRed.wl
I do not fully thought about this and I think it is ok


-------------------------------------------
2023.4.15
[I]
added a judgement in Summary.wl to refuse summarizing if not all missions are finished.

[II]
commented out a line
SectorIntegrals=Select[IntegralList[nIBPs],Sector[#]==sector&];
in SyzygyRed.wl
labeled by the date 2023.4.15
this seems to be a repeated code and of course unecessary...

[III]
fixing the case that SectorIntegrals={}
two major changes...
one of them is adding:
If[SectorIntegrals==={},
...
]

[IV]
in MissionStatusChecker.wl
code
If[Complement[Union[missionStatus[[All,2]]],{"ComputationFinished"(*,"Computing"*)}]==={},
		script="echo \"finished!\"\n";
		Break[];
	];
nonakano "Computing" is commented out.
This and today`s [I] solves a comment:
If bottom sector terminate unexpectedly, the process will NOT stuck and summarize. We should prevent this! Add a status checker to ensure all sectors finished before summarizing! Or maybe we can solve this from MissionStatusChecker, to modify one of its deciesion process. It terminates iff all mission finished.

[V]
labbeled new version 1.0.1.2

[VI]
added a fail report in SyzygyRed.wl 
If[step==s+OptionValue[AdditionalDegree],
	PrintAndLog["#",secNo,"\t\t  ","Targets are still not reduced to MIs in the maximum step ",step,". Failed.\n****** Sector ",secNo," Failed. ******"];
	Quit[];
]

-----------------------
2023.4.17
[I]
added PrintAndLog in Ini and Summary


[II]
modified 
If[Det[DM]^2!=1,Continue[]]; 
to 
If[Factor[Det[DM]]^2=!=1,Continue[]]; 
in MomentumMap

[III]
adding FindInstance implemented by YZ in MomentumMap, many modifications 

-----------------------
2023.4.19
[I]
Many Modifications in Pak_Algorithm.wl, upgrating MomentumMap

[II]
RW provided Spack scripts.

-----------------------
2023.4.20
[I]
Imported DeeperMomentumMap from YZ

[II]
if propagators are not linearly dependent and complete, let user know and wont compute

[III]
removed a option in default_settings.txt:
SubsectorIntegralPreference = "NumeratorDegree"
maybe I planned to add corresponding codes but gave up due to its being unnecessary?

-------------------------------
2023.4.21
[I]
modified Azuritino

--------------------------------
2023.4.23
[I]
many modifications to solve not-reduced problem, including adding new function ReduceTowards in SyzygyRed.wl

---------------------
2023.5.1
[I]
fixed a bug in ReduceTowards in SyzygyRed.wl, the previous version did not consider if targets are reduced or irreduced, would produce 200+ fake MIs. Now it won`t.

---------------------
2023.5.4
[I]
modified DenominatorTypeCompleting in SyzygyRed.wl, adding strategy "CompleteForEach" and set it to default.

[II]
Added report in Summary.wl to notice MI number difference with Azuritino


[III]
Added FindIBPs, many codes. to find more IBPs with seeds with denominator power indices lifted if curren MI number is larger than Azuritino.

[IV]
new version : 1.0.2.0

[V]
some new reports in sub section Row Reduce Modules in SyzygyRed.wl

-----------------------
2023.5.5
[I]
redesigned the algorithm for SymmetryMap in SyzygyRed.wl. Recoded it.

[II]
modified FindIBPs, not inputing large values basicnIBPs_ and basicSectorIntegrals_ ,
modified the denLift for loop inside to start from 0 rather than 1

[III] one modification in SyzygyRed.wl:
(*rawIBPs=SymmetryMap[sectorMaps,#]&/@rawIBPs;*)
rawIBPs=SymmetryMap[sectorMaps,rawIBPs];

------------------------
2023.5.6
[I]
modified:
SymmetryMap and ReduceTowards in SyzygyRed.wl
SymmetryMap: debugged the "Backward" mode rep and changed default direction to "Foreward"
ReduceTowards: considered irrelavant target integrals

----------------------------
2023.5.9
[I]
Added many codes in SyzygyRed.wl and Summary.wl
to addin AdditionalMISymmetries related usages

[II]
new version number 1.0.2.1

-------------------------------
2023.5.11
[I]
commented out an unused function in SyzygyRed.wl:
(*IBPSectorHeight[IBP_]:=Block[{LT},LT=LeadingIntegral[IBP]; If[LT==={},Return[-1],Return[SectorHeight[Int]]];];*)

[II]
added variable name protection step in Validating Inputs section in Initialization.wl. But we still need to add more names appear in Initialization.wl, Analyze_Sector.wl .... into the list ProtectedNames in Initialization.wl


[III] 
modifications in Initialization.wl:
(*If[FileExistsQ[#],Run["rm "<>#]]&[outputPath<>"tmp/"<>"initialized.txt"];*)
If[FileExistsQ[outputPath<>"tmp/"<>"initialized.txt"],
	Export[outputPath<>"tmp/"<>"once_initialized.txt",""];
	Run["rm "<>outputPath<>"tmp/"<>"initialized.txt"]
];
and in PrepareForContinueCompuation.wl:
If[FileExistsQ[tmpPath<>"once_initialized.txt"],
	Export[outputPath<>"tmp/"<>"initialized.txt",""];
]
to solve the comment:
I cannot  continue.sh after an mistaken attempt of ./run.sh? Nonesense.. (initialized.txt removed in the attempt)

[IV]
new version number 1.0.2.2

----------------------------------
2023.5.14
[I]
optimizations on CompensationIBPDenominatorDegrees
changed to
CompensationIBPDenominatorDegrees=Table[-1,Length[rawIBPs]];
	For[i=1,i<=Length[rawIBPs],i++,
		If[And[FreeQ[rawIBPs[[i]],FI0],FreeQ[rawIBPs[[i]],ZM0]],
			Continue[];
		];
		CompensationIBPDenominatorDegrees[[i]]=IBPSubSectorDenominatorDegree[nIBPs[[i]]]
	];
maybe even if the "If" does not really run the 3rd arguments if the 1st arg is True, if the 3rd argument is large (such as nIBPs), the If code is still time and memory consuming...

[II]
added a setting to silence the warnings in MomentumMap

[III]new version 1.0.2.3

----------------------------------
2023.5.23
[I]
fixed a bug in Summary.wl 

[II]
added allowing additional outputs

[III]
new version 1.0.2.4

---------------------------------
2023.9.4
[I]
 in SectorAnalyze:
I made plenty modifications, to cut nIBPs once new ones generated, rather than cut them together. This makes the computation faster. (not doing this in FindIBP because already did... but name of the vars are different)
Meanwhile, do the same to SectorIntegrals

in FindIBPs:
.../.sectorCut -> (#/.sectorCut)&/@...
not faster, but less memory used

[II]
added FlexibleNeatIBPIntersectionDegreeBound

---------
2023.09.12
[I]
added spanning cuts but not finished

[II]
in the past few days (a week or so), I added SimplifyByCut (not recorded), but this makes the vectors larger (even less the number). I turned it off in the default settings.

---------
2023.11.02
debugModification20231102:
In Azuritino, the criticle point method:
in the older version, we take MaxISPD=MinISPD+2, but some example shows that this is not enough. We modified it to:
MaxISPD=MinISPD*2+3 (to be conservative.)
However, this sometimes makes the max degree too high, we add an additional Break[] condition: if the MI unchange for continuous 2 steps, we break. (Previously we do not have this condition, just stupidly seed to the max degree.)

version 1.0.2.6

---------
2023.11.08
[I]
found a deeply lurking bug
In SectorAnalyze[], ini steps, if there are no sector targets, in the previous version, it does not Return[], although I wrote this
the reason could be, the Return[] is inside a MaxMemoryUsed[], so it just skip the rest steps in this MaxMemoryUsed, rather than Module[{},...]
now this has beed fixed

[II]
fixed incorrect timing and memory reports

[III]
in SyzygyRed.wl, SectorAnalyze[], removing zero sectors step, modified 
rawIBPs=Factor[CoefficientArrays[rawIBPs,integrals][[2]]] . integrals; 
to
rawIBPs=IBPCoefficientForm[CoefficientArrays[rawIBPs,integrals][[2]]] . integrals; 
where
IBPCoefficientForm is a option setting in default_settings.txt, defaultly, IBPCoefficientForm=Expand;
reason:
Factor some times is too slow


---------
2023.11.11
[I]
now, user can specify sectorwise settings in config.txt

[II]
added Lift selection and Further selection in SimplifyByCut


---------
2023.11.12
[I]
implemented Yang Zhang's SyzygyShorten into SyzygyRed.wl, SimplifyByCut[]
also, when using this function, I make CornerOnly->(DenominatorTypes==={sector}), if there are only corner target integrals, CornerOnly will on and the syzygy vectors will be less than CornerOnly->False.
and alalso, allow a setting of stricty while selecting syzygies

[II]
new version
1.0.2.7

-------------
2023.11.14

[NeatIBP 1.0.2.7]
Date: 2023.11.14
	1. Allowing setting Singular ordering through config.txt
