In SyzygyRed.wl

I have changed "!=" somewhere to "=!="  (zihao 2022.04 .06)
I have changed the name of variable "FF" to "FF1" in function \
SingularIdeal, to avoid possible contradiction with FiniteFlow. \
(zihao 2022.04 .08)
I have added some timing reports in the codes. 
  For this, a new variable is declared named TimingReportOfRowReduce. \
(zihao 2022.04 .08)
I have added many time reports (zihao someday)
I have added "exit;" in SingularIntersectionText and SingularSyzText \
in order to use them in command line (zihao 2022.04 .25)
I added PrintAndLog function. I replaced all Print[ 
  to PrintAndLog[ (zihao 2022.04 .29)
       I added an option to probe (zihao 2022.05 .03)
       
       zihao 2022.05 .06 :
      Function pivots[matrix] is defined twice. 
        I removed the first one. 
        I have make the RowReduceFunction optional. 
        By default using Hefeng`s SRSparseRowReduce.
        I have changed the default prime modulus from 32452843 to 42013
       I have modified \
"Mext=Join[Transpose[M],IdentityMatrix[M//Length]]//Transpose" to \
"Mext=Join[Transpose[M],SparseIdentityMatrix[M//Length]]//Transpose" 
       	in function UsedRelations. Where SparseIdentityMatrix[n_] := 
     SparseArray[Table[{k, k} -> 1, {k, n}]]
      	
      zihao 2022.05 .07
      I have deleted the step "CollectG" in function SectorAnalyze
      
      zihao 2022.05 .09
      In function SectorAnalyze, 
    		IBPISPdegrees = 
     IBPISPSectorDegree[#, sector] & /@ (CornerIBP /. GenericD // 
          Expand)
       has been modified to 
       		IBPISPdegrees = IBPISPSectorDegree[
         			Collect[
          				# /. GenericD /. GenericPoint,
          				Cases[Variables[#], _G]
          			]
         			, sector
         		] & /@ (CornerIBP);
    		
    zihao 2022.05 .12  
     when cauculating sector #938 of the triplebox example, 
    the SingularIntersection returned a VectorList, 
    such that VectorList[[212]] = 0, 
    but it is supposed to be a vector, not 0.
     The phenomenon comes from the Singular running step, 
    after simplify (m12, 12) command, 
    the 212 th element of the result matrix is 0, 
    but it is supposed to be linear combinations of gen ( ...)
     The Singular website is failed, 
    so I cannot study why this is happening (maybe because the \
simplification mode 12)
     The problem singular script is in  /home/zihao/projects/
         SyzygyRed/Parallelization/test_triplebox/
      intersection_test _bug _ 938. sing, 
    we should study what maybe wrong as soon as the Singular website \
recovered.
      Now, we have no choice but to add a command 
     If[Count[vectors, 0] > 0, 
      PrinAndLog["#", secNum, 
       "  ZEROs in VectorList Encountored!!They are deleted."]; 
      vectors = DeleteCases[vectors, 0]]; 
    in function IntersectionRead.
       BUT REMEMBER!! This is a YAN - ER - DAO - LING behaviour, 
    because it is possible that there DO EXIST some BUGs in the \
Singular step, 
    and we just temply turn off the warning ... so ... The result may \
be WRONG!
     MAKE SURE you fix the possible bug once Singular website \
recover!/home/zihao/projects/SyzygyRed/Parallelization/
      test_double _pentagon/Analyze_Sector.wl
     
     zihao  2022.05 .13
     Singular web site has recovered.
      After looking it up, we can delete the command 
     If[Count[vectors, 0] > 0, 
      PrinAndLog["#", secNum, 
       "  ZEROs in VectorList Encountored!!They are deleted."]; 
      vectors = DeleteCases[vectors, 0]]; 
    in function IntersectionRead. 
      There seems to be no error. 
      What we only need to do is just modify the OptionSimplification \
from 12 to 14.
     
     zihao 2022.05 .16
     I added option in SectorAnalyze to choose module intersection \
method, Linear or Singular
      
      zihao 2022.05 .18
      required the program to report ByteCount of VectorList
      
      zihao 2022.05 .24
      Added an option to shorten the module M1 and M2
      
      In function SingularIntersectionMaker 
      varpara = Variables[Join[M1, M2]];
    is modified to 
      varpara = Variables[Join[M1ext, M2]];
    
    in string SingularIntersectionText
      module m = m1 + m2; is modified to module m = m1, m2;
    
    zihao 2022.09 .09
     added functions :
      FIBPSectorISPDegree
       FIntegralSectorISPDegree
       In function SectorAnalyze, 
    	IBPISPdegrees = IBPISPSectorDegree[
        			Collect[
         				# /. GenericD /. GenericPoint,
         				Cases[Variables[#], _G]
         			]
        			, sector
        		] & /@ (CornerIBP);
    has been modified to 
      IBPISPdegrees = FIBPSectorISPDegree[#, sector] & /@ FIBPs;
    Before the modification, 
    Zurich seeding gives more MIs than expected.

2022.09.13
support calculation in one folder


-----------------------------
2022.09.20
made a backup


-----------------------------
2022.09.22
[I]
put codes in Symmetry.wl into SyzygyRed.wl , but it still needs to include Pak.wl\

In SyzygyRed.wl added a step, sector mapping, before removing zero sector integrals (nearly at the botom of main function). Consequently, there will be no new target integrals in mapped sectors while complying AnalyzeSector.wl. 

[II]
Changed "Initialization.wl" so that:

A.set a framewor to deal with mapped integral targets.
The framework is set as:
1. The only mapped targets will occur as an input. If NeedSymmetry Option is turned on, we map these targets at initilalization, export the symmetry relations as IBPs, and export {} as MI.
2. Export the mission status of mapped sectors to be "ComputationFinished"

B.Moreover, at initialization, we additionally export zero integrals as zero.

[III]
created summary.wl
----------------------------------
2022.09.23

[I]
In SyzygyRed.wl
For[i=1,i<=Length[Global`NonZeroSectors],i++,
			subsector=Global`NonZeroSectors[[i]];
			Global`ReductionTasks[subsector]=Union[Global`ReductionTasks[subsector],Select[SubsectorInts,Sector[#]==subsector&]];
		];

changed Global`NonZeroSectors to tailSectors(=DeleteDuplicates[Sector/@SubsectorInts])

[II]
Added function MappedAndSubSectorsAllFinder in SyzygyRed.wl
Modified AnalyzeSector.wl to use MappedAndSubSectorsAllFinder rather than SubSectorsAllFinder to find RelavantSectors if NeedSymmetry is on. However, Initialization.wl temply remain the same, this may cause trouble when input targets are not in top sector but in separate subsectors. NEED TO BE IMPROVED!!!

[III]
Cancelled function SuperSectors[] in all .wl files but MissionStatusChecke.wl, because it is not used theres.

Modified function SuperSectors[] in MissionStatusChecke.wl (backuped old version using (**)). Originally, master missions were calculated real-timely. In new version, this tree structure is calculated at initialization and saved on the disk. The new function only read it and use.

[IV]
made a backup 


-----------------------
2022.09.26
[I]
In function SyzygyRed.wl, the step "sorting nFIPBs" is too slow, sometimes taking 50% the time cost.
I added some timeing reports in this step. 
As observed, the bottle neck link is IBPSubSectorDegree <- IntegralList <- SortBy
The IntegralList command automatically sort the integrals, but in this step we do not need.
So, I added an option to function IntegralList, to determine weather we sort the integrals. Default is yes.
Then ,I added option value SortTheIntegrals->False to function IntegralList where it was called by: 
IBPWeight
IBPSubSectorDegree
IBPISPSectorDegree
Length

[II]
added a criterion of step "sort nFIBPs": ByteCount

[III]
added function SectorSelfSymmetryIBPs

[IV]
made a backup. We will keep on adding symmetry inside sectors




----------------------
2022.09.27

[I]
Add sector self symmetry related codes in SyzygyRed.wl

modified codes from 

	nIBPs=rawIBPs/.FI[i_]:>nFIBPs[[i]]/.IntegralR->IntegralRealization;

	If[OptionValue[Verbosity]==1,PrintAndLog["#",secNo,"  ","\t\tAppending self-symmetries finished. Time Used: ", Round[AbsoluteTime[]-timer2], " second(s)."]];
	
	];
or 

If[Not[NeedSymmetry===False],

	];



At step obtaining the analytic IBPs, added codes:
(it seems nothing need to be added here --- 2022.10.13)
--------------
2022.09.28
[I]
made a backup

[II]
added SparseRREF package in the working folder. Modified <<SparseRREF` to Get[workingPath<>"SparseRREF/SparseRREF.m"]
After this , we expect that user no longer need to install SparseRREF manually when they get this program

--------------------
2022.10.13
[I]
renamed "Pak" to "Pak_Algorithm"
deleted functions not used in the package Pak_Algorithm.wl

[II]
fixed an error in Initialization.wl
modified 
mapIBPs=#-(#/.G[x__]:>GMapped[sectorMaps,{x}])&/@mappedTargets;
to
mapIBPs=#-(SymmetryMap[sectorMaps,#])&/@mappedTargets;

the former one is old wrong way of mapping

[III]
modified
SDim=Length[Flatten[MIs][[1]]/.G->List]
in Summary.wl to
SDim=Length[Cases[Variables[IBPs],_G][[1]]/.G->List]

================================
ver 3
================================
Statement:
Ver2 is up-to-date at 2022.10.13
In the new version I am going to refine the folder structure, which will be brand new. 
Also, the backup branch is pushed to github named 'branch20221013'. 
The Folder 'SyzygyRed_Parallel_v2' should be remained unchanged from now
--------------------------
2022.11.07
made a backup (codes only, no .git or more github related files) at 'github' folder

--------------------------
2022.11.14
[I]
seperated the workingPath and packagePath in all codes. 
removed the SyzygyRedPackagePath variable, it is useless.
moved settings
	SingularDirectory = "/usr/bin/Singular"
	IntegralOrder = "Global"
	OptionSimplification = 12;
into input files.
Added outputPath=Automatic. We need to test what if it is not Automatic

-------------------------------
2022.11.15
made some adjustments to tha shell scripts (and .wl files) to fit in the changes yesterday.

(**)ed codes
Print["If you see an error message saying cannot open LinearSyzForLinearModule_FF_v2.wl, you can ignore it for the current version:"]
Get["/home/zihao/projects/SyzygyRed/LinearSyz/LinearSyzForLinearModule_FF_v2.wl"]
in SyzygyRed.wl

renamed SingularDirectory to SingularApp to avoid confusion, in SyzygyRed.wl and config.txt
